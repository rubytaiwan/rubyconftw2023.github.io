  summary: |-
    <p>With the release of Ruby 3.1 in 2021, an enhancement arrived as <code>Process#_fork</code>, allowing us to override the fork method. This addition simplifies creating callbacks when forking. While there was no official method to track fork events prior to Ruby 3.1, this limitation didn&#39;t deter the community from exploring various approaches to achieve the same goal.</p>
    <p>In the past, Rails encouraged the use of <code>before_fork</code> and <code>after_fork</code> for connection management, redis-rb ensured fork safety by storing the <code>Process#pid</code> in a variable, and some even used threads to track fork events.</p>
    <p>During this session, I will delve into the backstory of <code>_fork</code> and explore the diverse methods the community employed for creating callbacks during forking prior to Ruby 3.1.</p>
